# Star Grab | Game

### Description

Star Grab is a color matching and math sums game to play with your friends or alone against the clock! Compare highscores, show off how many stars you’ve collected over the entire course of playtime, earn skill badges and enjoy the experience with dark-mode or light-mode themes.

### Rules

1. Collect as many star tiles as you can before the time runs out.
2. Selected titles must be of the same color in order to collect.
3. If you are struggling to find the correct tiles to match the target number, you can use a special move called 'scramble' to give you the edge with all new tiles.
4. Finally, points will be added to your overall score from stars tiles only. ex. a tile with a value of 12 and has a star, will give you 12 points.
